# bias_crime
Understanding crime patterns, particularly bias-related crimes, is essential for policymakers, law enforcement, and researchers striving to create safer and more equitable communities. This project is a comprehensive analysis of bias-related crime trends in Washington, D.C., from 2013 to the present, utilizing statistical methods, machine learning models, and data visualization techniques to uncover key insights.

Project Overview
This study leverages open-source data from Open Data DC to examine the nature and frequency of bias-motivated offenses across different wards. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and predictive analytics, I aim to:

Identify patterns and trends in bias-related crimes over time.
Analyze correlations between crime types, locations, and targeted communities.
Apply regression and classification techniques to predict potential areas of concern.
Visualize findings through interactive dashboards and data storytelling.
Methodology
Data Cleaning & Processing: Preprocessing raw data, handling missing values, and standardizing categories.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding crime distribution through summary statistics, time-series analysis, and geospatial mapping.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing regression models to analyze relationships between socio-economic factors and crime rates, and classification models to categorize offenses based on historical patterns.
Data Visualization: Utilizing Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create compelling visuals that communicate insights effectively.
Why This Matters
Bias crimes have profound social impacts, often targeting marginalized communities and reinforcing systemic inequalities. By applying data science methodologies to social justice issues, this project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform policy decisions, improve public awareness, and contribute to ongoing discussions on crime prevention and equity in urban spaces.

Next Steps
Refining the predictive model to increase accuracy.
Expanding the dataset with external sources for deeper analysis.
Developing an interactive Shiny or Tableau dashboard for public accessibility.
This project reflects my passion for using data science to drive social change, merging quantitative analysis with real-world policy concerns. Contributions, feedback, and discussions are always welcome!
