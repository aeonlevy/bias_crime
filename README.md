🚔 Bias Crime Analysis in Washington, D.C. Exploring trends, patterns, and predictions in bias-related crimes

Bias-motivated crimes disproportionately affect marginalized communities, and understanding their patterns is crucial for promoting public safety and equity. This project applies data science and machine learning to analyze bias crime data from Washington, D.C. (2013–Present), uncovering key trends and making data-driven predictions.

Project Goals

🔹 Detect Patterns → Explore historical crime trends across different DC wards

🔹 Predict Crime Occurrences → Build models to identify high-risk areas & crime types

🔹 Data-Driven Storytelling → Communicate insights through interactive visualizations


Tech Stack & Methodologies

📌 Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Open Data DC API

📌 Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

📌 Statistical Modeling: scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Regression & Classification Models

📌 Geographic Analysis: Folium, Geopandas


Key Findings & Insights

📌 Bias crimes are rising in specific wards, especially near government & educational institutions.

📌 Certain groups are more frequently targeted, with notable spikes during election cycles.

📌 Machine learning models can help predict potential high-risk locations based on socio-economic and demographic factors.


Next Steps

✅ Improve model accuracy with more datasets (e.g., census & economic indicators)

✅ Develop an interactive Tableau/Shiny dashboard for public access

✅ Collaborate with policy researchers for real-world impact


Why This Matters
Bias-related crimes aren’t just statistics—they impact real communities. By combining data science & policy analysis, this project seeks to drive informed decision-making and contribute to meaningful solutions.
